  Based in Toronto, Canada I'm currently working in the field of Data and Decision Sciences.
  I hold a BMath in Statistics and a MSc in Computer Science. I like to make the field of data
  science more accessible and understood by those around me.

  This site hopes serve as a future reference to myself and the best practices
  I've picked up along the way.

  Interests include the usual: binging bad TV, drinking coffee, and sitting in cool cafes.
